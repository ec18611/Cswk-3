<h2>FAQs</h2>

If your question is not answered below just give your local salon a call and our team will be happy to help.</p>

<button class="accordion">Can I Reschedule my appointment</button>

  <p>You can make changes to your appointment or reschedule up to 24 hours before you are due to visit. Just follow the instructions on your confirmation email and if in doubt give us a call and we will be able to help you.</p>

<button class="accordion">What happens if I don't turn up for my appointment?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We know life happens so we like to be as flexible as possible. That is why you can make changes to your appointment or reschedule up to 24 hours before you are due to visit. If you do not turn up for your appointment you will be charged a fifty percent fee of your booking as we will not have a chance to offer that appointment with your wonderful stylist to someone else.</p>
